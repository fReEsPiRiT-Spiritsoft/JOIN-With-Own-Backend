            <p class="highlight-text">
                <a routerLink="/summary" class="join-link">Join</a> is a kanban-based project management tool designed
                and built by a group of dedicated students as part of their web development bootcamp at the Developer
                Akademie. Kanban, a Japanese term meaning "billboard", is a highly effective method to visualize work,
                limit work-in-progress, and maximize efficiency (or flow). <a routerLink="/summary"
                    class="join-link">Join</a> leverages the principles of kanban to help users manage their tasks and
                projects in an intuitive, visual interface. It is important to note that <a routerLink="/summary"
                    class="join-link">Join</a> is designed as an educational exercise and is not intended for extensive

                            contacts to collaborate on your projects. Go to the "Contacts" section, click on "New
                            contact", and fill in the required information. Once added, these contacts can be assigned
                            tasks and they can interact with the tasks on the board.</p>

                            delete it. Deleting a card will permanently remove it from the board. Please exercise
                            caution when deleting cards, as this action is irreversible. Remember that using <a

                            from you and your team to ensure the board reflects the current state of your project. Have
